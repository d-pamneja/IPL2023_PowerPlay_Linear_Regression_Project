<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

In this machine learning project, the goal is to predict the powerplay runs scored in each inning of IPL matches using linear regression algorithms. The predictive model leverages information such as venue details, batting and bowling team compositions for each inning, and the participation of specific players in designated overs. 

The training dataset consists of two files, namely "IPL_Ball_by_Ball_2008_2022.csv" and "IPL_Matches_Result_2008_2022.csv," providing a comprehensive ball-by-ball record and match results from 2008 to 2022. The mean absolute error (MAE) serves as the evaluation metric for model performance. 

Various regression models, including Ridge, Lasso, Linear Regression, SGD Regressor, Bayesian Ridge, Kernel Ridge, HistGradientBoostingRegressor, MLPRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, BaggingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBRegressor, and LGBMRegressor, were evaluated. 

Ultimately, the Stacking Regressor emerged as the chosen model for predictions due to its lower MAE on the training dataset, despite a slightly higher error on the test dataset. The final test error, measured by MAE, stands at 8.579578436102235.

<!-- Data Description -->
## Data Description

1. **Training data**: You will be provided two files for training data, they are as following:
    * **IPL_Ball_by_Ball_2008_2022.csv**: This file contains a ball by ball record of each IPL match since 2008 to 2022. The column names are self explanatory. 
    * **IPL_Matches_Result_2008_2022.csv**: This file contains results of each IPL match since 2008 to 2022. The column names are self explanatory. 

The data can be found in the link given [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vora1011/ipl-2008-to-2021-all-match-dataset).

### Evaluation Metric
Here, the data has been evaluated using mean absolute error. The choice of the mean absolute error (MAE) as the evaluation metric for regression problems is rooted in its intuitive and straightforward interpretation. MAE calculates the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values, providing a clear and easily understandable measure of the model's accuracy. 

Unlike other metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), MAE does not heavily penalize large errors, making it more robust to outliers and ensuring that each prediction's impact on the overall evaluation is proportional to its magnitude.This property makes MAE particularly suitable for regression scenarios where the emphasis is on understanding the average magnitude of prediction errors without being overly influenced by extreme values. 

In essence, the simplicity and resilience of MAE make it a reliable choice for assessing the predictive performance of regression models in a manner that aligns with a practical understanding of the errors.

<!-- MODELS EVALUATED -->
## Models Evaluated
Here,in this project I have evaluated the performance of the following models:

* Ridge 
* Lasso 
* Linear Regression
* SGD Regressor
* Bayesion Ridge
* Kernel Ridge
* HistGradientBoostingRegressor
* MLPRegressor
* ExtraTreesRegressor
* BaggingRegressor
* RandomForestRegressor
* AdaBoostRegressor
* GradientBoostingRegressor
* XGBRegressor
* LGBMRegressor

Apart from that, I have also tried ensemble models, such as:

* VotingRegressor
* StackingRegressor

## Model Used 
Hence, we will use **Stacking Regresor** to make predictions. 

1. We can also use the voting regressor as well. However, since 
stacking has a lower MAE in train data set and the error on test dataset is marginally high than voting regressor, we will go for that.

2. Kindly note that either of the two models i.e. Voting and Stacking Regressor could be the ideal model as per my analysis.

<!-- MODEL PERFORMANCE -->
## Models Performance

The final test error, measured by Mean Absolute Error (MAE), stands at **8.5796**. This value represents the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual powerplay runs in the IPL matches. A lower MAE indicates better model accuracy, and in this context, the achieved MAE suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate by approximately 8.58 runs from the actual powerplay run values. 

While the current model performance is a good starting point, there is always room for improvement. It is ideal to consider experimenting with different features, tuning hyperparameters, or exploring more advanced models to further enhance predictive accuracy. Regular model evaluation and refinement can contribute to achieving even lower MAE values, resulting in more precise predictions for powerplay runs in IPL matches.
